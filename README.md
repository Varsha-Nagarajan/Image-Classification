# Image-Classification

This is a solution to the Cat vs Non-Cat exercise from "Neural Network Deep Learning" course by Andrew Ng et. al

Here, I have built :
(a) 2 Layer NN
(b) L layer NN (generalized version that can accomodate any number of layers)

The code is written out with relevant comments in Juypter Notebook. Feel free to fork the project and use it for your applications and reach out to me in case you need any clarifications.
